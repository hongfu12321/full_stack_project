## setup environment:
1. Setup node and typescript - package.json - script
   1. `tsc -w`: Compile `ts files` into `js files` and store it in `dist` directory.
   2. `ts-node src/index.ts`: Execute ts file
   3. The reason why we setup `yarn watch` and `yarn start`, because it can compile ts file much faster.
   4. `nodemon`: listen to any changes in the file, then re-run it.
   5. `yarn watch` -> `yarn dev`: Like a chain, first terminal compile ts-file to js-file continuously, second terminal re-run the node when index.js has changed.

2. Setup mikro-orm: let us interact with database, create tabl, etc
   1. yarn add @mikro-orm/cli @mikro-orm/core @mikro-orm/migrations @mikro-orm/postgresql pg
   2. install postgresql


## Learn new stuffs:
1. npm vs yarn
   1. yarn add -D [name]
2. javascript vs typescript
3. `npx tsconfig.json`: install configure file of typescript.
4. nodemon: listen to any changes in the file, then re-run it.
